# 💬 Basic Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

## 🎯 Goal

Build a simple *rule-based chatbot* in Python that responds to basic user inputs using predefined rules.

---

## 📝 Project Description

- The chatbot takes *user input from the console*.
- It uses simple if-elif conditions to match phrases like:
  - "hello" → "Hi!"
  - "how are you" → "I'm fine, thanks!"
  - "bye" → "Goodbye!"
- Any unknown input receives a default response like "I don't understand."

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Used

- if-elif-else conditionals  
- Functions and loops  
- input() and print() for interaction  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program runs a loop where it waits for the user's input.
2. Each input is matched against predefined rules.
3. Appropriate responses are printed.
4. Typing "bye" ends the chat session.
